            <p>TileMap's idea was started before Unity had an official Tile map integrated into the engine. That implementation came out while I was making this. And while i did work on it after that, the inspiration died out soon after. This was also one of the few larger projects that I worked on.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="how-it-works" tabindex="-1"><a href="#how-it-works"></a>How it works</h3>
<p>The base idea of the system is to split the map into chunks. For each of these chunk than we construct a mesh that we can manually submit for unity to draw. This way the whole visible area can be drawn by only a few meshes. The system has a built in support for layers as opposed to Unity's solution that uses multiple Tile map objects for the same thing. It can also generate a collision mesh for the map.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="problems" tabindex="-1"><a href="#problems"></a>Problems</h3>
<p>It uses a separate object for each tile witch is not memory efficient.</p>
