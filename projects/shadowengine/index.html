Both engines were started for University Homeworks, as we ususally get the option of miking something big as a proof that we understood the language. But as I started working on Shadow Engine the scope expanded quite fast. As a result I chose only the input system as the Homework assignment. But i did continue working on it after the CPP course ended. Next year I had a Dx12 optional course so that is why Shadow Engine uses Dx12 as the renderer. At the end of that semester I had a working but really simlple rederer. And in the comming months I did start the rewrite of that to be more robust and use more fatures. This is where the code is now (2021.07).</p><h3 id=state-of-the-code>State of the code</h3><p>There are two main branches in the SE repo.</p><ul><li><code>Main/master</code> contins a version that is actually runnable. This is using the old naive renderer that is quite slow and does not allow for many features.</li><li><code>d3d12</code> The rewiting of the renderer this is currently not supposed to run. The renderer currently only has the back end allocation and resource management components.</li></ul></div></article></main></div></body></html>
