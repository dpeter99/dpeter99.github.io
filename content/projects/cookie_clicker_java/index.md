This colone of the poppular idle game Cookie clicker was make in less than 3 days for a University assignment. It uses a modular structure and should be faery easy to implement the rest of the game. 

### Structure
It uses a registry system inspired by how Minecraft operates.
It also uses a separate thread for the counting of the cookies as that was a requirement for the assignment.
