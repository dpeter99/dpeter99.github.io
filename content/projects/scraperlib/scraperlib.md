Scarper lib is a small Kotlin library that can extract recipe (food recipe) data from a few common websites.
It was built as part of [Grocery]() a recipe collecting Android app that I made for a Uni homework.

The library currently supports:
 - Allrecipes
 - Delish
 - Mindmegette
 - Nosalty
 - Tasty
