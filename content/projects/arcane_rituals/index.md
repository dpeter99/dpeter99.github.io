Arcane Rituals is my Minecraft mod made using Forge.

## Origins
The origins of this mod and the basic idea for it is really old. I started it first as a vanilla data pack but i got upset with the lack of custom block models. So the first thing i tried to do was to somehow make blocks be able to get custom models. This was the original reason I started looking into how modding works. After a bit of a digging and learning how the internals of MC work I realized it was not possible to do in a sane way. So i bit the bullet and started on the slippery slope of MC modding. 
At first I started to work on it in 1.14 and moved to 1.15 with ease. But at this point I lost motivation so stated to work on other projects. But after getting upset in a private SMP server about how the anvil works I decided to pick up the mod again and get at least some form of magical anvil working.
