**This project is discontinued**

Currently, I only use this site for a short text that describes the status of forge update to the newer version.

### The origin

This was a plan for a community-made Forge modding tutorial. While it was a good idea many of the write-ups for it ended up in [Forge Community Wiki](https://forge.gemwire.uk/wiki/Main_Page)
What that project provides over this is the ease of editing for anybody who wants to. While this is true I personally don't like php based text editing, as I like knowing what I have written so far is saved. But that project has a lot of great resources and great community support. I will be moving most of the useful things from there to the Wiki
