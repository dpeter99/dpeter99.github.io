With 1.18 around the corner, it looks like we are going to keep 1.16 as the LTS (Long term support version).
What this means is that 1.17 will lose support, and the forge team will stop accepting PRs to the repo. 1.17 had a good run, but due to all the changes in the underlying code of both Forge (The big peel for example) and Minecraft it never actually got a recommended release.
Because of this and the switch to the official mappings, it did not gain that wide of adoption. But with the new version soo close, we are trying to finalize this version so we can close the version with a recommended build.
 

With this, the triage team is closing down most of the Pull requests, to prepare the repo for next week's release and subsequent porting of Forge. This doesn't mean the ideas and changes behind the closed PRs are bad. Most of them are quite good and we would love to see them come back as new 1.18 PRs. So I would encourage everybody to port their PRs when the new 1.18 is out and in a state where the development can start again.
