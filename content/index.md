I'm a 22-year-old guy studying Computer Sciences at university.
My main interests are game and game engine programming but I try to expand my knowledge in every field of computing.
Because of this I now have looked into hobby OS, website, full-stack, and even documentation development. This has resulted in a lot of started projects and even more that are still just ideas.
