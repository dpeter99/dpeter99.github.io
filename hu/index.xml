History The engine started off as a cpp rewrite of my 2D game engien RelicEngine made in C, but this scope was quickly outgrown. Both engines were started for University Homeworks, as we ususally get the option of miking something big as a proof that we understood the language. But as I started working on Shadow Engine the scope expanded quite fast.</description></item></channel></rss>
